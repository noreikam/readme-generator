## Description<a id='description'></a>
The application takes user input and generates a quality README.md file.  It uses terminal prompts from the Inquirer NPM and leverages the fs (file-system) NPM to create the output.  The output includes links to GitHub and your email for questions, a badge for the license, a working table of contents, and appropriate header styling.  


## Installation<a id='installation'></a>
First, download this repository to your local machine.  You will also have to downloade Node if it is not already on your machine.  Open the repository in an editor such as Visual Studio Code.  Type 'npm install' in the terminal window to create the node_modules folder.


## Usage Information<a id='usageInfo'></a>
Type 'node index.js' in the terminal window to begin the application.  You will be prompted for a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution instructions, test instructions, a license, your GitHub username, and your email.  Some of these are required and are marked as such.  When all prompts are provided, a new README.md will be created in the 'dist' directory.
