## Description<a id='description'></a>
The application is a mobile restaurant app that helps users find new food to try.  A search area is selected and restaurants with detail such as ratings, cuisine, and price range are shown along with photos.  Five random restaurants are returned every search.  If you like a restaurant, you can save it to your favorites list.   


## Installation<a id='installation'></a>

## Usage Information<a id='usageInfo'></a>
Choose a city from the dropdown and click 'Find My Food!' to begin.  Currently only Hartford County is in scope via a cty dropdown.  In the future a text input will allow for a wider search area.  The first result's details will automatically display.  To view the details of another result, click the restaurant name under 'Local Restaurants'.  Clicking the 'Add Favorite' button will save the currently displayed restaurant to your favorites.  To view your list of favorites and revisit those details, click 'Favorites' at the right.
